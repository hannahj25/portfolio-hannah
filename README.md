# PORTFOLIO

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to establish a simple portfolio webpage that I can utitlise to showcase other projects/work.

## Specifications

I needed the page to contain: 

   Name and photo/avatar 

   A brief introduction/about me

   A section for displaying projects (currently with placeholders, to be filled in later with future works)
   
   Contact information

The page is structured with links to each section and uses a responsive layout that can be viewed on different screen sizes.
